I have set up the basic structure of the new frontend with a dual-pane layout, toolbar, breadcrumbs, and a file list.

To see the current progress, please run the following commands in the `FileFlow/frontend` directory:

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm start`

I will now wait for your feedback before proceeding with further implementation.
